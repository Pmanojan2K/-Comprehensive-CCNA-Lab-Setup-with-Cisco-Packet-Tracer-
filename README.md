### Scenario: Building a Robust Network for a Mid-Sized Company

**Objective:**

i am the network administrator for a mid-sized company, and your task is to design and implement a comprehensive network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network must support the company's growing needs while ensuring security, scalability, and efficient data routing. 

**Network Requirements:**

1. **Static IP Addressing:** Assign static IP addresses to critical devices like servers and routers to ensure consistent network performance and manageability.
2. **Subnetting:** Divide the network into subnets to enhance performance and security by minimizing broadcast traffic and organizing devices logically.
3. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implement ACLs to control the flow of traffic and secure the network by allowing or denying traffic based on IP addresses and protocols.
4. **OSPF Routing:** Use OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) to dynamically route traffic within the network, ensuring optimal path selection and efficient data delivery.
5. **Port Address Translation (PAT):** Enable PAT to allow multiple internal devices to share a single public IP address for accessing the internet, conserving IP addresses and enhancing security.
6. **Serial Cabling:** Set up serial links between routers to establish WAN connections, facilitating communication between different office locations.
7. **DNS Server Configuration:** Configure a DNS server to resolve domain names to IP addresses, making it easier for users to access internal and external websites.
8. **Mail Configuration:** Set up a mail server to handle the company's email traffic, ensuring reliable and secure communication.
9. **Web Server Configuration:** Deploy a web server to host the company's website, providing an online presence and supporting web-based applications.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Static IP Addressing:** 
   - Assign static IP addresses to the main servers (DNS, mail, and web servers) and core network devices (routers and switches).
   - Ensure IP addresses are well-documented and reserved within the subnet.

2. **Subnetting:**
   - Plan and create subnets for different departments (e.g., HR, Sales, IT) and for servers, ensuring logical segmentation and enhanced security.
   - Calculate and allocate IP ranges for each subnet.

3. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
   - Define and apply ACLs on routers to restrict access to sensitive areas of the network.
   - For example, allow only specific IP ranges to access the financial server.

4. **OSPF Routing:**
   - Configure OSPF on all routers to enable dynamic routing.
   - Ensure proper area configuration to optimize routing efficiency.

5. **Port Address Translation (PAT):**
   - Configure PAT on the edge router to allow internal devices to access the internet using a single public IP address.
   - Verify the PAT setup to ensure connectivity.

6. **Serial Cabling:**
   - Connect routers using serial cables to establish WAN links.
   - Configure the serial interfaces with appropriate IP addresses and ensure connectivity between remote offices.

7. **DNS Server Configuration:**
   - Install and configure the DNS server to handle internal name resolution.
   - Create DNS records for internal servers and services.

8. **Mail Configuration:**
   - Set up the mail server with the company domain.
   - Configure user accounts and ensure secure mail transfer protocols (SMTP, IMAP, POP3).

9. **Web Server Configuration:**
   - Deploy and configure the web server to host the companyâ€™s website.
   - Ensure the web server is accessible internally and externally.

**Outcome:**

By following these steps, i will create a robust, secure, and scalable network for the company. The network will support efficient data routing, secure communication, and reliable access to critical services, enabling the company to operate smoothly and grow without network limitations. This lab scenario provides practical experience with essential networking concepts and prepares you for real-world network administration challenges.
